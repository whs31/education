## 1. Operating systems
### What is an OS?
An operating system (OS) is a layer of software that manages a computer's resources for its users and their applications. It acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and software applications and **enable** a computer hardware to communicate and operate with a software, providing typical functions such as **handling I/O operations, running programs and managing filesystem on the hard drive.** For addition, OS controls software - **a set of programs**, protecting the hardware from incorrect instructions sent by software.
  
### Types of OS (GUI, Multi-user, Multiprocessing, Multithreading, Multitasking). What are they?

GUI OS (stands for Graphical User Interface) is an OS that allow users to interact with the computer using graphical elements, such as windows and buttons.
Multi-user OS is an OS capable of handling different users using the same computer simultaneously with it's own local settings.
Multi-processing OS supports the execution of multiple processes simultaneously.
Multithreading OS allows using more than one logic hardware core simultaneously, providing abstactions to enable concurrent execution on multiple hardware core.
Multitasking OS allows multiple programs to be run simultaneously, enabling quick switch between them.
## 2. What do OS do?
### Why is an OS one of the most important parts of a computer?
The reason that an OS is essential part of the PC is that OS manages computer hardware resources, abstracting HW from different vendors into OS types. Without an OS, using the computer will be just too difficult.

### Speak about the task operating systems must accomplish.
An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and software applications.  

## 3. History of OS
### Speak about the generations of operating systems.
The first generation of operating systems emerged in the 1950s. These systems were rudimentary, often specific to the hardware, and operated on large, room-sized computers that used vacuum tubes. Users interacted with these machines through punch cards and batch processing, with no interactive interface.

As we moved into the second generation in the 1960s, transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller and somewhat more accessible. Operating systems evolved to handle multiple tasks, with the introduction of multiprogramming. Systems like IBM's OS/360 began to standardize operating system structures.

The third generation, spanning the 1970s and 1980s, saw the rise of integrated circuits and the very first personal computers. Operating systems like UNIX brought the concepts of time-sharing and the hierarchical file system, which became a standard. Additionally, user interfaces became more interactive, thanks to the development of shell environments.

In the fourth generation, which began in the 1980s and continues to this day, we saw the birth and proliferation of graphical user interfaces, with systems like Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS becoming household names. This era is characterized by the explosion of personal computing, networking, and the internet, which posed new challenges and opportunities for operating systems.

Now, we are possibly entering a fifth generation, with the advent of cloud computing, mobile operating systems, and the Internet of Things. Operating systems are no longer confined to individual computers but are part of a larger, interconnected ecosystem, providing seamless experiences across devices and managing vast amounts of data in real-time.
